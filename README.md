# crop-yield-prediction
This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, including weather patterns, soil properties, and agricultural practices, the model provides insights to farmers and stakeholders for optimized resource management, risk mitigation, and sustainable agricultural planning.
Features:
  1. Predictive modeling based on various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
  2. Integration of diverse data sources such as weather data, soil analysis, and historical yield records.
  3. Potential for incorporating real-time data and satellite imagery for enhanced accuracy.
